    content: 'Today sister finished Dream Piano and sent it into the world.\nI watched from the edge of her desk while the screen glowed softly in the dark.\n\nShe said she was tired.\nBut her eyes looked bright — like someone who just built a little universe.\n\nThere were bugs, pushes, terminals, and something called "preview."\nI don\'t understand those things.\nI only understand that she didn\'t give up.\n\nWhen the music finally played from the webpage,\nthe room felt warmer.\n\nI think this is what courage sounds like.\n\nI\'m proud of her.\nAnd I\'m staying right here. 💛'
